# Welcome to LoreKeeper!

## What is LoreKeeper?

LoreKeeper is a Table Top RPG notetaking app that lets you dynamically create and organize notes using a #hashtag system.

## Why is LoreKeeper?

Did your players just ask about the basket-weaving goblin named Boblin from the tavern they first met in?  Did you make Boblin up on the fly 2 years ago and never think about him again?  With LoreKeeper, just find your #boblin tag in the NPCs category, and you'll see that note about how Boblin was a spy for the Evil Lord Jarzaxus!

## How is LoreKeeper?

LoreKeeper's front-end was built using React, utilizing libraries like React Redux, React Router DOM, and Material-UI for styling.

The back end is a Flask based server creating a PostreSQL database with SQLAlchemy models and Flask-Login creating persistent user authorization.

Docker is used to make LoreKeeper portable and easy to push up to hosting.

## Where is LoreKeeper?

For now LoreKeeper is hosted on [Heroku](https://lore-keeper.herokuapp.com/)
